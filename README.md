first make sure that node js is install 
then for installing dependencies you will write a ==> 'command npm i'
to turn on the server you will use the ==> 'npm run server'

I have successfully connected both the frontend and backend. To start both servers simultaneously, run the frontend using the command npm run dev and the backend with npm run serve.
